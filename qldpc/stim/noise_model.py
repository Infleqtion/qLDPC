"""Implementation of different noise models for Stim quantum circuits.

This module provides a comprehensive framework for adding noise models
to quantum circuits built with Stim.

The main components are:
- NoiseRule: Defines how to add noise to individual operations
- NoiseModel: Controls the application of noise across entire circuits
- Built-in noise models: si1000 (superconducting) and uniform_depolarizing
- Automatic TICK insertion with idling errors

Example:
    Basic usage with a predefined noise model:

    import stim
    from qldpc.stim.noise_model import NoiseModel
    
    # Create a simple circuit
    circuit = stim.Circuit()
    circuit.append('H', [0])
    circuit.append('CX', [0, 1])
    
    # Apply superconducting-inspired noise
    noise_model = NoiseModel.si1000(0.001)
    noisy_circuit = noise_model.noisy_circuit(circuit)

    Custom noise model example:

    # Create a custom noise model
    custom_model = NoiseModel.custom(
         idle_depolarization=0.0001,
         clifford_1q_depolarization=0.001,
         clifford_2q_depolarization=0.01,
         measure_flip_z=0.02
     )
    noisy_circuit = custom_model.noisy_circuit(circuit)
