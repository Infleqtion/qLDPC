qLDPC documentation
=================================

This library is a collection of tools to construct and analyze finite-size `quantum low density parity check (qLDPC) codes <https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/c/qldpc>`_ codes.  Its primary purpose is to make developments in the quantum error correction literature accessible to a broader audience of physicists, computer scientists, and tinkerers.  The hope is that these tools facilitate the discovery and design of practical, finite-size codes for near-term (or at lest medium-term) quantum computers.

At the moment, this documentation page is largely auto-generated from docstrings that were written to be legible in the source code, so formatting will occasionally be wonky.  I will work on fixing the formatting in time.

See the `readme page <https://github.com/qLDPCOrg/qLDPC>`_ for a high-level overview of the qLDPC library.
